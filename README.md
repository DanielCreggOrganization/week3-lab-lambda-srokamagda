# Lab: Introduction to Lambda Expressions in Java

## Objective
This lab will introduce you to the concept of lambda expressions in Java. We’ll start by understanding what interfaces are, work with a basic example, and then move towards creating and using lambda expressions.

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
1. Understand the purpose of interfaces in Java.
2. Create your own interface with a single abstract method.
3. Write and use lambda expressions to simplify code.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of Java syntax.
- Familiarity with methods and basic classes.

## Part 1: Understanding Interfaces

### What is an Interface?
An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. It is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. Interfaces cannot have method implementations (except for default and static methods) and are typically used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

### Example: Creating and Using an Interface
In the `src` folder, create a package called `ie.atu.lambda`. Inside this package, create a simple interface called `MathOperation` with a single method `operate`:

```java
// Define the interface
interface MathOperation {
    int operate(int a, int b); // Single abstract method
}
```
Next Create a class called `Addition`.
```java
// Implement the interface using a class
class Addition implements MathOperation {
    public int operate(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
Finally, create a class called `Main`. Add the `main` method. Create an instance of the MathOperation interface using the Addition class. Finally we call the `operate` method of the `addition` object and print the result.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperation addition = new Addition();
        System.out.println("Addition: " + addition.operate(5, 3));
    }
}
```

### Try It Yourself: Create Your Own Interface
1. **Create a new interface** named `StringOperation` with a single abstract method `apply` that takes a single `String` parameter and returns a `String`.
2. **Create a class** called `ToUpperCase` that implements `StringOperation` and overrides the `apply` method to convert the input string to uppercase.
3. **Test it** by creating an instance of `ToUpperCase` in your `main` method and calling the `apply` method with a string of your choice.

## Part 2: Moving to Lambda Expressions

### What is a Lambda Expression?
A lambda expression is a shorter way to implement a functional interface (an interface with only one abstract method). It allows you to create anonymous methods and can be used to simplify the code. In essence, lambda expressions are a way to represent instances of functional interfaces more concisely.

### Syntax of a Lambda Expression
The basic syntax is:

```java
(parameters) -> {body}
```

### Example: Using a Lambda Expression
Let’s refactor our `MathOperation` example using a lambda expression:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression instead of implementing the interface via a class
        MathOperation addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
        
        System.out.println("Addition: " + addition.operate(5, 3));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
In the above example:
- The lambda expression `(a, b) -> a + b` is used to define the `operate` method of the `MathOperation` interface.
- It takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum.

### Try It Yourself: Refactor with Lambdas
1. Refactor your `StringOperation` interface from Part 1 to use a lambda expression in the `main` method.
2. Replace the implementation of `ToUpperCase` with a lambda that converts the string to uppercase.

## Part 3: Benefits of Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions make your code shorter and more readable. They are particularly useful in:
1. Reducing boilerplate code for single-method interfaces.
2. Writing more expressive and functional-style code.

### Example: Simplifying Threads with Lambdas

Consider creating and starting a new thread in Java. Traditionally, you might do this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Traditional way using an anonymous class
        Runnable task = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread is running");
            }
        };
        
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

Using a lambda expression, you can simplify this code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Thread is running");
        
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

In the above example:

- The `Runnable` interface is a functional interface with a single abstract method `run()`.
- We replaced the anonymous inner class with a lambda expression `() -> System.out.println("Thread is running")`.
- This makes the code more concise and easier to read.

### Try It Yourself: Simplify Runnable

1. **Create a `Runnable` instance** using a lambda expression that prints "Hello from the thread".
2. **Start a new thread** with this `Runnable`.
3. **Observe the output** to ensure your thread is running as expected.

**Sample Solution:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Hello from the thread");
        
        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Exercise: Custom Functional Interface

Let's create our own functional interface and use lambda expressions with it.

1. **Define an interface** named `Calculator` with a single abstract method `calculate(int x)`.
2. **In your `main` method**, create a lambda expression that implements `Calculator` to compute the square of a number.
3. **Test your lambda** by calling the `calculate` method with a number of your choice.

**Sample Solution:**

```java
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int x);
}
```
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator square = (int x) -> x * x;
        
        int result = square.calculate(5);
        System.out.println("Square of 5 is: " + result);
    }
}
```

## Part 4: Putting It All Together

Let’s build a final example that combines multiple lambda expressions. Here we will use a Java inbuilt functional interface called `Function`. It can take one argument and produces a result.

### Example: Combining Operations

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define a lambda to reverse a string. Function<String, String> defines a function that takes a String as input and returns a String as output
        Function<String, String> reverse = s -> new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();

        // Define a lambda to convert a string to uppercase
        Function<String, String> toUpperCase = s -> s.toUpperCase();

        // Combine lambdas
        Function<String, String> combinedOperation = reverse.andThen(toUpperCase);

        // Apply the combined operation
        System.out.println("Result: " + combinedOperation.apply("Lambda"));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

In this example:

- We used `Function<String, String>` to define lambdas that reverse a string and convert it to uppercase.
- We combined these operations using `andThen` to create a new operation.
- The `andThen` method executes the first function and passes its result to the second function.

### Try It Yourself: Create Your Own Lambda Chain

1. **Create three lambdas**:
   - One that trims whitespace from a string.
   - One that replaces spaces with hyphens (`-`).
   - One that converts the text to lowercase.
2. **Combine these lambdas** using `andThen` or `compose`.
3. **Test your chain** with a string of your choice.

**Sample Solution:**

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function<String, String> trim = s -> s.trim();
        Function<String, String> replaceSpaces = s -> s.replace(" ", "-");
        Function<String, String> toLowerCase = s -> s.toLowerCase();

        // Combine the lambdas
        Function<String, String> combinedOperation = trim.andThen(replaceSpaces).andThen(toLowerCase);

        // Test the combined operation
        String result = combinedOperation.apply("   Hello World From Lambda   ");
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Result: hello-world-from-lambda
```
